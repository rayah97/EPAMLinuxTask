#About less command

Less is a program similar to more(1), but which  allows  backward  movement in the file as well as forward movement.  Also, less does not have to read the entire input file before starting, so with large input files it starts up faster than text editors like vi(1).   Less uses termcap (or terminfo on some systems), so it can run  on  a  variety  of  terminals.
There  is  even  limited support for hardcopy terminals (On a hardcopy terminal, lines  which  should be  printed  at  the  top of the screen are prefixed with a caret.)
